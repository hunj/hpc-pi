## Computation of Pi using HPC

Implementing four well-known mathematical formulas for computing Pi: 
- Ramanujan-Sato series
- Chudnovsky Algorithm
- Brent-Salamin Formula
- Monte-Carlo Method. 

Using parallel computing on Case HPC, collect results and compare each with several criteria such as accuracy and memory consumption. Will use Pi Day organization's Pi value to measure the accuracy.

To ensure fairness of each implementation, we introduce several constraints such as: implementing in Python, running computation in a given timeframe (e.g. 24 hours), using same HPC configurations (e.g. using same amount of cores).
